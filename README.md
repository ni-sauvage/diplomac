# A Diplomacy Move Interpreter
## Written by Niall Sauvage

The idea of this project is to create an interpreter for the board game [diplomacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy_(game)). If I get enough of it working in reasonable time, I'll work on hosting this as a diplomacy sandbox simulator.
